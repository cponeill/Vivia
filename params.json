{"name":"Vivia","tagline":"","body":"# Vivia\r\nVivia is prototype that is a simple AI assistant. Currently it calls the Spotify API and uses the annyang voice activation JS library to search for a desired song or artist. The name Vivia means \"living\" or \"alive\" as the goal of this project is to give the product the feel of coming alive. This project is currently being worked on and I will update it as much as can be. The goal is to make create more of a robust AI assistant that works with many different API's to get the results the user is looking for. \r\n  ![](https://github.com/cponeill/Vivia/blob/master/public/images/Vivian.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
